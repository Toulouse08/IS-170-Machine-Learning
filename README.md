Considered to be a classification approach, but can also be employed for regression problems. SVM Constructs a hyperplane in multidimensional space to separate different classes. Generates optimal hyperplane in an iterative manner, used to minimize an error. Core idea of SVM is to find a maximum marginal hyperplane that best divides that dataset into classes. Applications include Face detection, Bioinformatics, Text Categorizatin, Generalized Predictive Control, Handwrinting REcognition, Image Classification.
